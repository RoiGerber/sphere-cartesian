### What’s the Problem with Dividing by Zero?

Intuitively, it might feel like dividing by zero should give us "infinity." So, why don’t we just say that? Why is it considered "undefined"?

The answer lies in the idea of one-sided limits. Take the function f(x)=1/x. When we approach x=0 from the right, the values get larger and head toward infinity. But when we approach from the left, the values decrease, approaching negative infinity. So which one is it—positive or negative infinity? This inconsistency leads us to define the result as "undefined."

But what if we offered a solution? What if we created a model where both infinity and negative infinity are the same point? Imagine the number line as a circle, where the farthest right point connects to the farthest left point—so infinity and negative infinity are one and the same.

(Of course, this is a circle with an infinite radius, which is why it still looks like a straight line to us.)

In this solution, we map each point on the number line to a position on the "circle of numbers." We apply this to both the X and Y axes. This transforms the Cartesian plane into a kind of sphere, where every point represents a unique (x, y) coordinate. On this new coordinate system, we can draw any function in its entirety, fully covering the range from negative infinity to infinity. Unlike the regular Cartesian system, where we wave our hands and say "it continues forever," here we capture the whole function at once.

### How Does the Mapping Work?

To project any point from the regular Cartesian plane onto our sphere, we draw a line from that point through the top of the sphere. This line will intersect the sphere at some point. The intersection is the projected point, as illustrated in the image.

Naturally, very distant points move higher up on the sphere, and the projections of points at infinity—no matter from which direction—converge precisely at the top of the sphere.
